 |   Assignment:  Program #5 Part 2 ROT47
 |
 |       Author:  Leo Przybylski
 |     Language:  
 |   To Compile:  gcc -DPROGRAM_LOG_LEVEL=0 prog04p3.c -o prog04p3
 |                There are different log levels:
 |                0 - DEBUG
 |                1 - INFO
 |                2 - WARN
 |                3 - ERROR
 |                The debug level is set at compile time.

 |
 |  Description:  ROT47 algorithm implementation. Encrypts/decrypts a string 
 |                passed into STDIN.
 |
 |        Input:  An ascii string that needs to be decrypted or encrypted. Valid
 |                input is anything with the ascii decimal value between 32 and 
 |                126.
 |
 |       Output:  Encrypted/Decrypted string
 |
 |    Algorithm:  ROT47 algorithm. Presents the ascii characterset as 
 |                a rotatable interface that can rotate 47 characters in either
 |                direction and yield the same output. 47 is half the characters
 |                in the applicable set, so rotating 47 places in either direction
 |                always yields the same result. Likewise, rotating twice always
 |                results in the initial location. This allows decryption and
 |                encryption to follow exactly the same algorithm.

/*------------------------------------------------- main -----
  |  Function main
  |
  |  Purpose:  Reads input from STDIN using getchar(), iterates over 
  |            each character and prints the result from rotate
  |            to stdout using putchar()
  |       
  |
  |  Parameters: argc (IN) -- Doesn't really do anything with this
  |              argv (IN) -- Doesn't really do anything with this.
  |                
  |
  |  Returns:  Only success

/*------------------------------------------------- rotate -----
  |  Function rotate

  |            character _c_. 
  |
  |  Parameters: c (IN) -- Character to apply ROT47 algorithm to
  |                
  |
  |  Returns:  ROT47 rotated character value
  *-------------------------------------------------------------------*/

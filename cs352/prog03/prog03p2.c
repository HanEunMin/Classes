 |   To Compile:  gcc -DPROGRAM_LOG_LEVEL=0 prog03p2.c -o prog03p2
 |                There are different log levels:
 |                0 - DEBUG
 |                1 - INFO
 |                2 - WARN
 |                3 - ERROR
 |                The debug level is set at compile time.

 |  Description:  Decode output from the od command (no arguments). od is a linux
 |                command. With no arguments, it outputs 16-bit octal encoded
 |                strings. The objective is to parse and decode these strings into
 |                their original ascii input.
 |
 |        Input:  Input is basicall what od outputs. It is intended that od will be
 |                piped into the program like this: od hello | prog03p2
 |
 |       Output:  The output would be whatever is in hello
 |
 |    Algorithm:  scanf is used to read each set of digits output from od into a 
 |                variable. Only one set of digits is read at a time. Byte count 
 |                digits are ignored and thrown out by checking for modulus 9.
 |                That is, every 9 sets of digits, a set is thrown out. The last set
 |                set is also always thrown out. In some cases, the data will not end
 |                perfectly, but the last set of digits is always a length.
 | 
 |                Each set of digits is then processed individually. A set of digits
 |                is a set of two ascii characters in reverse. The first character is
 |                parsed by applying a mask to the digits. This will 0 out the first 
 |                bits of the 16-bit string leaving only the last 8-bits which 
 |                represent the first character. Then, to get the second byte/
 |                character, the digits are shifted 8 positions to the right. The 
 |                same mask applied previously is then applied on the second set of
 |                bits. This represents our second byte. The output is then printed
 |                using printf.

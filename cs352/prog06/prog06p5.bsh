#  Assignment:  Program #6 part 5 Create a Grading Script for prog04p3.c.
#
#      Author:  Leo Przybylski
#    Language:  Bourne Again Shell Scripting Language
#  To Compile:  pfftttt... yeah, sure
#
#       Class:  CSc 352 â€” Systems Programming and UNIX
#  Instructor:  Dr. Lester McCann
#    Due Date:  October 13th, 2011, at the beginning of class

# Description:  Bash script to create a time lapse animated gif from images 
#               archived from the Gould-Simpson webcam. 
#
#       Input:  The year in YYY format (2005 < year < 2012)
#               The starting month in MM format. (0 < month < 13)
#               The starting day in DD format.  (0 < day < 32)
#               The ending month in MM format. (0 < month < 13)
#               The ending day in DD format. (0 < day < 32)
#               The time for each day to grab images. This time must be a multiple
#               of 5 because images are captured every 5 minutes. (-0001 < time < 2400)
#               Time must be in 24-hour format
#
#      Output:  The result is an animated gif in the current working directory
#               named przybyls.gif
#
#   Algorithm:  Iterates over months, then days in the month to determine what
#               images to use. If months intersect, then the entire month
#               in between is applied. Starting and ending months are special cases.
#               The starting month images begin on the start day. The ending month
#               images end on the end day. Otherwise, all normal rules apply.
#
#  Known Bugs:
